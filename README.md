## Not needed anymore for 1.1

**This has already been added to the most recent psychology update for 1.1.**
**You can still use this for 1.0**

Makes it so that newly-recruited pawns don't get the "faction imprisoned me" -40 penalty to everyone in the colony, which made it nearly impossible for new recruits to form positive relationships. Pawns which were already part of the colony and then arrested still get it.

**From the original post:**
Why isn't this in Psychology?

I suggested it to The Word-Mule, and they said no. If they change their mind, the source code's available[github.com].
